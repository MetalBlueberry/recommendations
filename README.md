I've been working with Víctor all my life. We have had good and bad moments, but he is always full of energy and looking forward to learning new things.

Víctor always approaches new challenges analysing the situation carefully before taking the first step. He likes to discuss with other team members before moving forward. He can be stubborn sometimes, but he is working to be more flexible. I've seen a clear improvement in this behaviour during the last years.

He knows a lot of different technologies and he can learn whatever he needs really quickly. He has no fear from unknown fields.

If you need help, he is always willing to explain to you whatever he can. You can see that he enjoys sharing knowledge.

You must fill the header fields with appropriate data. The body of the recommendation is up to you. This is just another hugo post, so you can make use of any shortcode to include content. If you want something special, let me know it.
